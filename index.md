## Canadian Anesthesiologists Society - Residents' Section

Formed in 1995, the CAS Residents’ Section creates programming for residents at the annual CAS conferences and beyond. We act as a unified voice on the behalf of residents to address specific issues and concerns.

Goals:

  * Facilitating a community of Canadian anesthesiology residents
  * Connecting Canadian anesthesiology residents with the CAS
  * Representing Canadian anesthesiology residents at the CAS
  * Creating programming relevant to anesthesiology residents
